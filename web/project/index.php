              <h3>Our Calculator makes it easy to figure out how much to purchase.</h3>
                    <p><b>Scenario:</b>It's harvest time and your group of friends wants to do some home canning and make homemade applesauce.
                        You've been charged with purchasing apples for everyone. 
                        Your group decides that a full portion is $50 worth of apples (this is the full portion budget). 
                        Some people want full portions and others want half portions. Others may want double or triple portions.
                        You need to figure how many boxes of apples to purchase for the group based on the # of portions requested</p>
